# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
This repository contains the implementation of various GANs techniques. 

 `src` folder contains the implementation of the GANs, and `notebooks` folder contains the notebooks used to train and test the models.

 Most of the models will be trained on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. To train the models on the other datasets, you can use the same code with minor changes with the shapes.

# Generative Models
This repository contains the implementation of various generative models, e.g., GANs, VAEs, Transformers, Diffusion Models, etc.

## GANs
GANs folder contains the implementation of various GANs, e.g., DCGAN, cGAN, AcGAN, LS-GAN etc. 
 `src` folder contains the implementation of the GANs, and `notebooks` folder contains the notebooks used to train and test the models.

## AE_VAEs
AE_VAEs folder contains the implementation of various Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders.
    `src` folder contains the implementation of the models, and `notebooks` folder contains the notebooks used to train and test the models.
